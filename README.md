Hi, this is the Technical Test solved.

I used Next.js and Node.js on their most lts version. I followed up the guidelines required for the implementation of the project and I deployed on Vercel app. you can see on live the 
behavior of the test, I used Tailwind CSS for the styles of the project. You can also find a button for simulate changes on the data locally on the button of "Edit a Random Post". Then,
after a minute you can see the logs of the changes that have been ocurred on the posts.

I provide the link for the page: https://technicaltest-one.vercel.app/.
